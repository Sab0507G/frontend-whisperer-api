# Smart QR Attendance System

Project Overview
A modern, full-stack web application designed to automate and secure classroom attendance tracking. It uses dynamic, time-sensitive QR codes and a real-time data sync mechanism to ensure immediate, verified presence marking, effectively eliminating manual errors and proxy attendance.

Deployed on:-
https://smart-qr-attendance-system-git-main-sab0507gs-projects.vercel.app

Key Features
> QR Code Attendance: Students scan a unique, time-sensitive QR code generated by the system to mark their presence.
> Real-Time Data Sync: Attendance records update instantly across all connected teacher and student devices.
> Role-Based Access: Features separate, dedicated dashboards for teachers and students, ensuring focused functionality.
> Analytics Dashboard: Provides teachers with tools to track attendance trends and view daily summaries.
> Modern UI: Features a clean, responsive interface for an optimal user experience across all devices.

Technical Workflow
> Session Initiation: The teacher starts attendance, prompting the backend to generate a unique Session ID and set a short expiration time (e.g., 30-60 seconds).
> QR Display: The teacher's frontend displays the dynamic QR code representing the Session ID.
> Student Scan: A student scans the code. The student's portal sends their ID and the Session ID to the backend.
> Validation: The backend validates the request, checking the student's ID and ensuring the Session ID is still active and unexpired.
> Data Persistence: If valid, the attendance record is securely saved in the database.
> Instant Update: The real-time service immediately pushes the new attendance record to the teacher's dashboard as well as updates attendance in the student's dashboard, providing live attendance visibility.
